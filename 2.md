### What is ArgoCD?

* **Argo CD** is an open-source, declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It helps developers and DevOps teams automate deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes clusters.

* **Argo CD** lets you define the **desired state** of applications and resources in a Git repository, then continuously monitors the cluster to ensure the **actual state matches the desired state**.

* **Argo CD** follows GitOps principles:

  * Application state is defined in Git.
  * Continuous delivery system automatically synchronizes the **actual state** with the **desired state**.

Got it üëç thanks for clarifying ‚Äî your uploaded images are about the **characteristics/features of ArgoCD**.
Let me give you a neat, structured list of **ArgoCD characteristics** that you can directly use:

---

# üîπ Characteristics of ArgoCD

1. **GitOps-Based**

   * Uses Git as the single source of truth for declarative configuration.

2. **Declarative Setup**

   * Applications, environments, and deployments are defined as code (YAML/Helm/Kustomize).

3. **Automated Sync**

   * Continuously monitors Git repositories.
   * Automatically applies changes to keep Kubernetes clusters in sync.

4. **Multi-Cluster Support**

   * Can manage and deploy applications across multiple Kubernetes clusters from one control plane.

5. **UI and CLI Support**

   * Provides a rich web UI, CLI, and API to manage applications.

6. **Real-Time Application Status**

   * Visualizes live vs. desired state of applications.
   * Shows health status and sync status clearly.

7. **Access Control & Security**

   * Supports SSO (OIDC, LDAP, SAML).
   * Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

8. **Rollbacks & History**

   * Maintains version history of deployments.
   * Easy rollback to a previous Git commit or application state.

9. **Helm & Kustomize Support**

   * Works natively with Helm charts, Kustomize, plain YAML, and Jsonnet.

10. **Scalability & Extensibility**

    * Designed to handle large-scale microservices.
    * Extensible via custom plugins and notifications.

Perfect üëç Let‚Äôs break down **ArgoCD Architecture** in a simple way so you can easily explain it in interviews or notes.

---

# üîπ ArgoCD Architecture

ArgoCD is a **Kubernetes-native GitOps continuous delivery tool**. Its architecture has the following key components:

---

## 1. **API Server (argocd-server)**

* Central component that provides **UI, CLI, and REST API**.
* Communicates with users, CI/CD pipelines, and Git repositories.
* Handles authentication (SSO, OAuth2, LDAP, etc.).

---

## 2. **Repository Server (argocd-repo-server)**

* Connects to Git repositories.
* Clones the repo, renders manifests (Helm, Kustomize, YAML).
* Provides the **desired application state** to the API server.

---

## 3. **Application Controller (argocd-application-controller)**

* The **brain** of ArgoCD.
* Continuously compares:

  * **Desired state** (from Git)
  * **Live state** (in Kubernetes cluster)
* Decides whether to sync, rollback, or alert about drift.
* Performs actual **sync operations** to bring the cluster in line with Git.

---

## 4. **Redis**

* Caching layer to improve performance.
* Stores application, cluster, and repo state temporarily.

---

## 5. **Dex (optional)**

* Used for Single Sign-On (SSO).
* Integrates with OAuth, LDAP, GitHub, Google, SAML.

---

## 6. **Kubernetes Clusters**

* ArgoCD can manage **multiple clusters** from one installation.
* It applies manifests to these clusters.

---

# üîπ ArgoCD Workflow (How it works)

1. **Git Repo (Source of Truth)**

   * Stores application manifests (YAML/Helm/Kustomize).

2. **Repo Server**

   * Fetches and prepares manifests.

3. **Application Controller**

   * Compares desired (Git) vs live (cluster).

4. **Sync Process**

   * If drift found, ArgoCD syncs cluster to match Git.

5. **API Server & UI**

   * Lets users view status, trigger syncs, rollbacks.
